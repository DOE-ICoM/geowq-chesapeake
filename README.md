### Setup

#### Software

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

#### Data

* Locate the observational data file `all_data.csv` (download from figshare if necessary)

* Sync its path with the location defined in `data/params.csv`

### Usage

#### Generate training data

```shell
# executes scripts/00_get_data.py
make data_aggregated_gee_csv
# manually upload aggregated_gee.csv to GEE
# manually download results to data/unique_pixeldays_w_bandvals.csv
make data_aggregated_w_bandvals_csv

# add freshwater influence predictor
make data_w_fwi
```

#### Train RF model

```shell
# variable selection + initial fitting
make data/X_train_salinity.pkl

# hyperparameter tuning
make data/rf_random_salinity.pkl
```

#### Pull prediction data

```shell
python scripts/03_get_data_predict.py --date "2022-09-04"
```

#### Generate prediction surfaces

```shell
python scripts/04_rf_predict.py --date "2022-09-04" --variable salinity --var_col "SSS (psu)"
python scripts/04_rf_predict.py --date "2022-09-04" --variable turbidity --var_col "turbidity (NTU)"
python scripts/04_rf_predict.py --date "2022-09-04" --variable temperature --var_col "SST (C)"
```
